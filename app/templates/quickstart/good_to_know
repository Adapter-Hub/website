<p>Adapter weights are usually initialized randomly. This requires a higher than normal learning rate. 
We have found that setting a learning rate of <code>lr=0.0001</code> works quite well for most settings</p>
<p>Depending on your data set size you might also need to train slightly longer than usual. 
We usually evaluate the adapters after each epoch on the development set and store the best model. </p>
