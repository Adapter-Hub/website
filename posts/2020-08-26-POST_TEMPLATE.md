## First section

This is an example post showing how the blog of the AdapterHub website works.
Every post is saved in a Markdown file like this one in the `posts` folder.
The yaml section at the top of this file specifies some metadata, e.g. the post's title and author.

## Second section

A post can contain all kinds of content supported by markdown:

### Lists
- First item
- Second item

### Code

A short snippet of Python code. Syntax is explained at https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/.

    :::python
    for i in range(42):
      print("Hello World!")
